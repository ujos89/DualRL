bathrooms  were  disgusting.  order  was  wrong.  food  was  burnt.  over  charged  for  the  monday  special.
service  was  good  food  was  incredibly  bland  and  over  priced.  i  wouldn't  recommend  this  place.
out  of  business  in  oregon  due  to  franchise  going  bankrupt.
2pm  sunday.  closed  thought  the  sign  said  tavern.
worst  customer  service ,  avoid  at  all  costs.  careless  and  rude  staff.  never  coming  back!
this  cafe  sucks  butt.  really  bad  customer  service  will  never  drink  from  there  again.
from  the  undercooked  beans  to  the  rice-a-roni  filling ,  i  can't  imagine  a  worse  burrito.
no  cars  left  despite  my  reservation.  sad  customer  service--national  you're  better  than  this!
