the  jajangmyeon  noodles  entree  is  decent.  the  service  is  poor.  i  will  not  be  returning.
food  was  great ,  music  for  the  belly  dancer  was  deafening.
cute  place  .slow  service  but  really  good  food  with  friendly  staff!
cheeseboy  is  awesome.  the  heavy  handed  servings  of  jalapeno  are  not.  you  have  been  warned!
good  but  too  expensive  for  my  taste.  i  choose  coco  donuts.
not  bad  chinese ,  considering  few  better  options  in  somerville/porter  square  area
decent  location  and  friendly  staff.  prices  are  still  significantly  higher  than  home  depot.
the  greek  food  was  delicous  wait  staff  was  average  the  decor  could  of  been  better
good  work  thank  you  boston  audio  design  very  satisfied  here.
not  much  to  say ,  standard  business  hotel ,  polite  staff ,  well  located.  clean  and  comfy.
