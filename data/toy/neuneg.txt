same  horrible  experience  as  others.  totally  unreliable  and  unprofessional  expect  a  no  show!
one  of  the  worst  vietnamese  places  in  boston  chinatown.  their  portions  are  the  measliest.
horrible  experience.  food  takes  forever  and  it's  not  even  good.
bbq  pork  (char  siew)  is  terrible.probably  the  worst  in  the  region.  but  groceries  are  great!
closed  out  of  business
light  drinks ,  ridiculous  veggie  sushi ,  clueless  service ,  overpriced.  never  again.
poor.  go  to  chili's  up  the  street.  tried  to  feed  me  fake  jack  daniels!  weak.
worst  chai  latte  i  have  ever  had.  it  tasted  like  boiled  puke  water.  never  again
i  would  not  recommend  coming  here.  terrible  service  and  taste  is  not  good.
to  my  absolute  dismay ,  wang's  has  been  closed  for  months  and  replaced  by  new  managment
